## 👋 About Me
Welcome to my cybersecurity portfolio. I am an aspiring **Cybersecurity Analyst / Junior Pentester** currently documenting my journey from fundamental theory to advanced practical application.

This repository serves as a live tracker of my progress, separating verified skills from ongoing learning. My approach combines rigorous theoretical study (Cisco/ISC2 standards) with custom Python tool development.

## 🚀 The Roadmap (2026)
The core of this repository is my detailed **[Cybersecurity Roadmap 2026](Cybersecurity_Roadmap_2026.md)**.
It tracks my competency levels (1-4) across key domains:
*   **OSINT & Reconnaissance** (Sherlock, DNSDumpster)
*   **Network Enumeration** (Nmap, Wireshark, Subnetting)
*   **Vulnerability Assessment** (SQLi, XSS)
*   **Custom Tooling** (Python Automation)

---

## 💻 Featured Projects (Python Automation)
Beyond theory, I believe in *building to understand*. I develop my own security and automation tools to grasp the underlying mechanisms of protocols and APIs.

### ⚔️ Katana (Network Scanner)
*   **Description:** A multi-threaded network scanner and reconnaissance tool.
*   **Features:** Port scanning, Banner Grabbing, Subdomain enumeration via brute-force, and HTTP Security Header analysis.
*   **Tech Stack:** Python (`socket`, `requests`, `threading`).

### 🕵️ Job Hunter (OSINT Automation)
*   **Description:** An automated agent that scrapes and filters job opportunities.
*   **Features:** Uses Selenium for "Deep Scanning" job descriptions to extract hidden salary data and filtering by specific keywords.
*   **Tech Stack:** Python (`selenium`, `regex`).

I am actively preparing for the following industry-standard certifications:
*   **ISC2 Certified in Cybersecurity (CC)** - *Competent (Level 2)*
*   **Cisco Certified Support Technician (CCST) Cybersecurity** - *Competent (Level 2)*
